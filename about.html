	<h2>This is a starter project for quickly & easily building a completely bespoke and powerful static site.</h2>
	<p>The project is put together with complete extendability and modularity in mind, so all you have to do is stitch your site together with the responsive building blocks, however you want to use them. The project is built on a solid foundation of sound build structure and a powerful CSS framework, so all you have to do is extend it to fit your style and grow it into as big or small a site as you want.</p>
