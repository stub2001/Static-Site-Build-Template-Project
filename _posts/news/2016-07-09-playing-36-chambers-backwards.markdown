Led Zeppelin and The Beatles are not the only people to supposedly backmask hidden messages through their music... Enter the Wu Tang.

It has been recently discovered if you play 36 Chambers backwards and listen carefully, you can hear O.D.B. reading out his mother's recipe for guacamole. On a later track, Ghostface Killah can be heard to give out smart fiscal advice on the diversification of your stock market investments. Most interestingly of all, an unknown voice that sounds suspiciously like Elvis predicts not that only that Tupac is still alive, but that he was behind 9/11. The FBI are investigating this claim.
